I made this simulator for fun yesterday. Here you can see how viruses attack to red cells. I wanted to use it to study biology though I couldn't use it because to make it first I need some help with biology. I could ask for ask to my teacher but I don't have enought time so I won't update this anymore (I think but I'm not really sure). So feel free to use the whole code if you want, I hope this is more helpful for you than it was for me.
To release viruses simply do click on the screen. You can release as viruses as you want though it's better to release just one, it's more epic.
